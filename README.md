# ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èWhat is this repository?
**üí¨This repository contains a basic implementation of a blockchain in the C Language. Follow the instructions below to use this code. (Note: The program already includes a GUI, so don't worry, it will be intuitive to use).**\

# ‚öôÔ∏èHow to compile and run the code?

## üö®Prerequisites - Windows
To be on the safe side, when possible, use the administrator mode to perform the following installations and accesses. You will need to install OpenSSL and GCC. \
**‚ö†Ô∏è<u>[Win64 OpenSSL v3.3.2‚¨áÔ∏è](https://slproweb.com/download/Win64OpenSSL-3_3_2.exe)</u>** -> Windows  
**‚ö†Ô∏è<u>[Win64 OpenSSL v3.3.2‚¨áÔ∏è](https://slproweb.com/products.html)</u>** -> alternative link
  * Attention! Install it in the Windows directory. After that, add the OpenSSL directory `C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin` to the PATH (to learn how, click [_here_](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/).
  
  ‚úîÔ∏èNow you are ready to run `/.exe/blockchain.exe`.


**‚ö†Ô∏è<u>[GCC - C compiler‚¨áÔ∏è](https://github.com/brechtsanders/winlibs_mingw/releases/download/13.2.0posix-18.1.5-11.0.1-ucrt-r8/winlibs-x86_64-posix-seh-gcc-13.2.0-llvm-18.1.5-mingw-w64ucrt-11.0.1-r8.zip)</u>** -> 64bits version \
**‚ö†Ô∏è<u>[GCC - C compiler‚¨áÔ∏è](https://winlibs.com/)</u>** -> Alternate link with the specific version(13.2.0 (with POSIX threads) + LLVM/Clang/LLD/LLDB 18.1.5 + MinGW-w64 11.0.1 (UCRT) - release 8) and others.

1. After downloading the .zip file, extract it to the root directory C: (this will place the mingw64 folder in the specified directory). 
2. To use GCC in the command prompt, you should add the directory C:/mingw64/bin/ to the PATH(to learn how, click [_here_](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/).
3. Go to `C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\include\`, copy the directory `\openssl`, and paste it into `C:\mingw64\include\`.
4. Now go to the directory `C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\lib\VC\x64\MD\` and copy the files `libssl.lib` and `libcrypto.lib` to the directory `C:\mingw64\lib\`.
5. Navigate to the project folder where main.c is located and execute the following command:
      ```console
   gcc main.c blockchain.c -o main -lssl -lcrypto
   ```
* `gcc`: Invokes the GNU compiler.

* `main.c`: The source file you want to compile.

* `blockchain.c` = Functions File.

* `-o main`: Sets the output executable file name to main.

* `-lssl` with the `-l` option: Links the OpenSSL library (libssl), used for cryptographic functions.

* `-lcrypto` with the `-l` option: Links the OpenSSL library (libcrypto), used for additional cryptographic functions.\
  üéâDone! Now you have an executable `main.exe` in the root of the project, and you can test the code with the `.exe` you generated yourself.üòÑ.


## üö®Prerequisites - Linux
### üößUnder construction... 
(the need for OpenSSL and GCC remains, include the necessary libraries and headers, and compile the code as shown in the Windows instructions).
